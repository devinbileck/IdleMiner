# IdleMiner

This program allows you to mine cryptocurrency while still being able to utilize your machine without having to manually start/stop the mining application.
It does this by defining `idle` and `active` settings. For example, it can mine at maximum hash rates (utilizing all CPU and GPU resources) while you are idle
and either disabled or reduced hash rates (minimal CPU and GPU resources) while you are active on the machine.

**Note:** Currently only the [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) mining application is supported.

## Getting Started

**Note:** xmr-stak must already be downloaded and configured.

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/devinbileck/IdleMiner/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip file into the same folder as xmr-stak.
3. Run IdleMiner.exe - It will show up in the Windows system tray (notification area).
